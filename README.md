# Blood Transfusion Service Analysis
## Overview
This MATLAB project is a comprehensive analytical endeavor that focuses on understanding blood donation trends and behaviors from a blood transfusion service dataset. Through a series of statistical analyses and visual representations, this project aims to provide insights into donation frequencies, monetary contributions, and other critical metrics that can influence future blood donation strategies.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Implements strategies to handle missing data and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates essential statistics like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation to understand data distribution and central tendencies.
- **Visual Representation**: Utilizes MATLAB's powerful plotting tools to create histograms, scatter plots, box plots, bar graphs, and pie charts, offering a visual interpretation of the underlying data.
- **Random Sampling**: Employs random sampling techniques to create training and testing datasets, ensuring robustness in the analysis.

## How to Run
- Ensure you have MATLAB installed on your system.
- Open the script in MATLAB and run it to execute the analysis and view the results.

## Collaboration
This project was developed in collaboration with a peer, with the goal of enhancing our data analysis skills using MATLAB and gaining deeper insights into the field of blood donation services.
