#Blood Transfusion Service Analysis
This MATLAB code represents a comprehensive statistical analysis and data visualization project for a blood transfusion service dataset. The program performs tasks such as data cleaning, handling missing values, statistical computations (mean, min, max, standard deviation, variance, covariance, and mode), and splitting data into training and testing sets. It also includes a diverse array of visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, box plots, bar graphs, and pie charts, to illustrate the distribution and relationship between different variables like recency of donation, frequency, and volume of blood donated. This project showcases skills in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and creating insightful visual representations of data.
